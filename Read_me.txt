🌍 Global Water Scarcity & Freshwater Quality Analysis

Using Data Mining Techniques

📌 Overview

This project applies data mining techniques to analyze freshwater quality and global water scarcity using real-world datasets. It combines classification and clustering to extract meaningful environmental insights.

🎯 Objectives

Classify water samples as potable or non-potable

Analyze global water stress at the country level

Group countries based on water stress severity

Extract actionable insights using data mining methods

🧠 Techniques Used

Random Forest → Water potability classification

K-Means Clustering → Country-wise water stress grouping

Min-Max Scaling → Feature normalization

Evaluation → Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Silhouette Score
